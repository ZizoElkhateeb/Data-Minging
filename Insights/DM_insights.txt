The number of movies released increased a lot from 2003 to 2009 because:

More production companies, filmmakers, and distributors got interested in making movies.
People wanted to watch more movies.
It became easier to show movies all over the world because of the internet.
New technology made it cheaper to make movies.
People's interests and what they liked in movies changed, so more movies were made to fit what they wanted.

In year 1937 the average (mean) earnings from movies were higher compared to other years.
in 1937 where the minimum, maximum, and mean earnings were equal may be attributed to mathematical calculations.
With only one film released, its earnings had a significant impact on the average.
In contrast, in other years with more films released, there is likely to be greater variability in earnings, leading to larger differences between minimum, maximum, and mean earnings.
This reflects the mathematical effect of individual values and variability on the average, which can be less stable in years with greater earnings variability

conclusion : while some years had really successful movies making a lot of money on average, overall, movies were making more and more money each year.

Film-Noir genre tends to have higher median IMDb ratings compared to other genres, while Sport genre has the lowest median IMDb rating.
This suggests that movies categorized under Film-Noir are generally better received by viewers, while those categorized under Sport might not be as well-received on average.

Films categorized under Film-Noir may have higher average ratings, their gross earnings might not necessarily reflect this.
On the other hand, films under the Horror genre seem to generate higher profits despite potentially lower average ratings.

The difference in the relationship between genres (average ratings, and gross earnings) can be attributed to various factors:
Audience Preference: Horror films have loyal fans who watch them despite lower ratings. Film-Noir movies are admired by a smaller group, resulting in higher ratings but lower earnings.
Production Costs: Horror movies are cheaper to make, leading to higher profits. Film-Noir films cost more to produce, reducing profits despite good ratings.
Market Competition: Horror films face less competition, allowing them to earn more. Film-Noir struggles against other genres, impacting its earnings.
Cultural Influence: Audience tastes change based on cultural trends. Horror films align with current preferences, while Film-Noir may not, affecting their commercial success.
